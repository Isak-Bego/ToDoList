# ToDoList
This project is a proof of knowledge towards the usage of modules, classes and factory functions. It is part of the project Odin Web Development course and aims solidify all the knowledge gained in this course so far. 

# Requirements
-It should feature projects: A 'project' is simply a separate page with to-do list objects focused on a particular thing. 
-Each todo object should at least have a Title, Description, dueDate and priority. 
-The user should be able to view all the projects, view the todos in each project, delete a todo, and expand a to do for more details. 

# Required Techniques of Implementation
1. todo Objects should be dynamically created, using factory functions, or object constructors. 
2. Application logic should be separated form DOM-related stuff. They should be kept in separate modules.
3. The app should make use of the Web Storage API to store the information in the users PC.
